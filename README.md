### Description

This is an Electronic book Viewer. It supports rtf and txt, not .lit and .pdf formats. The reason why I wrote this is that I found a lot of Fantasy Books at http://21ct.gooddays.org/books.html and started reading them in Wordpad/Notepad. That proved difficult, so I created this program to allow me to read the text as close as possible to Micro$oft's MSREADER. You can change font size, set bookmarks,change the fore color, back color, margins etc etc. I use it and it works form me. If you like it, please vote or at least leave a comment. If you don't like it, tell my why so I can inprove. I included one of Raymond E Feists books for you to test the app with. Enjoy !!! - I added experimental adware code...
